i am learning to make a text editor by making it in a simple way.
i am not using the file manipulating funtcions like fopen fgets fputs by using open read write instead for better understanding for myself.
the problem i am facing or the idea i do not have is that backspacing a newline character, other problems i do not feel much irritating.
i am first reading the file content into a string and then creating a backup and deleting the mainfile (i can rename the original file which i will code)
now i have to know how to edit string and show it like vim or nano


todo:
->everything works fine except usage of shell commands
->change the use of arrow keys their ascii is added as input in the file
->the first character in the new file is a random character ,know the reason that causes that
