open file
     [
     if present
     edit
     ]
     [
     if doesn't exist
     create
     ]
create backup
       [
       if newly created
       no backup required
       (have to make)
       ]
       [
       if old file opened
       make another file with  slight name change
       read contents of file
       write in backup file
       (another method is to just rename the file name if it is possible in c)
       ]

edit buffer
     [
     to edit the string buffer and to display it while editing
     (have to make)
     ]

write back
      [
      after editing is completed
      create a file with original name(666 is the general permission for a text file)
      write buffer contents to file
      ]

problem
	[
	X->not able to show the running edit mode as expected
	a random character is present in the newly created file (using an instruction to the user to first press a backspace before entering any text)
	]


solved
	[
	found a way to show it as vim but not as fast because using shell commands in between to convert type if IO in the shell
	]
